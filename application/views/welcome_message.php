        Yeah, that's right; this old site is coming back VERY soon, new and improved after being down, what, nine years now? 
        Only thing is, I don't have many relevant pictures of my own to use for this site. Sure, I could
        grab images from the web, but I don't want to have to answer BRI requests to remove them. I AM 
        accepting donations! If you have relevant pictures 300dpi or higher you can send me, please inform me 
        by sending an e-mail. The address begins "siteguy@" and then add "banana," then the hypen, then "and," then another 
        hyphen, then the key two to the right from "M" on a QWERTY keyboard, then "org." The sooner 
        I acquire some usable pictures, the sooner this paragraph with that hackneyed Comic Sans font 
        can go away.
